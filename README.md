# Flowstability

Flowstability is a branch of fluid dynamics developed to study how laminar-turbulent transition happens. In this repo I present some computation methods used in stability analysis.

### Topics

1. Stationary solution of the Navier-Stokes equation (equilibrium flows)
2. Solving the Reynolds-Orr equation using the compound matrix method
3. Solving the Orr-Sommerfeld equation using the compound matrix method
4. Solving the Orr-Sommerfeld equation using spectral method
5. Non-ormality, spectrum, pseudospectrumand numerical range
